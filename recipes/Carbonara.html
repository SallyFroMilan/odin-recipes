    <p>A typical dish from <strong>Roma</strong>, appreciated all over the world!<br>
    Based on pasta, eggs, guanciale and pecorino cheese. A simple dish, but heavenly good!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Spaghetti</li>
      <li>Guanciale thickly cut</li>
      <li>2-3 egg yolks</li>
      <li>Pecorino romano cheese</li>
      <li>About 1 tablespoon of pasta cooking water</li>
      <li>Black pepper and salt</li>
    </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>First of all, cut the bacon into squares and place in the pan.
          Then place a large pot with water on the stove to boil the spaghetti. When it boils, throw a handful of rock salt, then the spaghetti.
          At the same time, heat the guanciale in the pan over a gentle heat.</li><br>
      <li>The guanciale should not harden by frying too much, but should soften gently, releasing all the "fat" it will need to saut√© the spaghetti.
          It will take about 2 minutes. In the meantime the water will have come to the boil, cook the spaghetti.</li><br>
      <li>How to make the egg yolk cream for a perfect Carbonara:
          mix the egg yolks with most of the pecorino cheese (leave 1 teaspoon for the seasoning) and pepper. Add 1 tablespoon of pasta cooking water to avoid an omelette effect.
          The cream must be soft, but at the same time full-bodied and velvety. The colour should be intense and not too pale.</li><br>   
      <li>Drain the spaghetti super al dente directly into the hot pan with the bacon (keeping the cooking water to one side).
          Then add 2 - 3 tablespoons of the pasta cooking water. Stir everything together for 1 minute over a high heat.
          Finally turn off the heat, remove the pan from the hob and pour the egg yolk cream over the spaghetti. Stir for a few seconds, add pecorino cheese, 1 - 2 tablespoons of boiling cooking water to promote creaminess and pepper!</li><br>
      <li>Buon appetito!</li>
