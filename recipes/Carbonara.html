    <p><em>A simple dish, but heavenly good!</em></p>


    <h2><strong><em>The authentic pasta carbonara recipe</em></strong></h2>
        
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Spaghetti</li>
      <li>Guanciale thickly cut</li>
      <li>2-3 egg yolks</li>
      <li>Pecorino romano</li>
      <li>About 1 tablespoon of pasta cooking water</li>
      <li>Black pepper and salt</li>
    </ul>

      <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>First of all, cut the bacon into squares and place in the pan.
          Then place a large pot with water and coarse salt on the stove to boil the spaghetti. When it boils, throw them in.
          At the same time, heat the guanciale in the pan over a gentle heat.</li>

      <li>The guanciale should not harden by frying too much, but should soften gently, releasing all the "fat" it will need to saut√© the spaghetti.
          It will take about 2 minutes. In the meantime the water will have come to the boil, cook the spaghetti.</li>

      <li>How to make the egg yolk cream for a perfect Carbonara:
          mix the egg yolks with most of the pecorino cheese (leave 1 teaspoon for the seasoning) and pepper. Add 1 tablespoon of pasta cooking water to avoid an omelette effect.
          The cream must be soft, but at the same time full-bodied and velvety. The colour should be intense and not too pale.</li>   

      <li>Drain the spaghetti super al dente directly into the hot pan with the bacon (keeping the cooking water to one side).
          Then add 2 - 3 tablespoons of the pasta cooking water. Stir everything together for 1 minute over a high heat.
          Finally turn off the heat, remove the pan from the hob and pour the egg yolk cream over the spaghetti. Stir for a few seconds, add pecorino cheese, 1 - 2 tablespoons of boiling cooking water to promote creaminess and pepper!</li>
      <li>Buon appetito!</li>
