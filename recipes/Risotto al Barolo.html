      <li>Barolo wine</li>
      <li>Meat stock</li>
      <li>Leeks</li>
      <li>Extra virgin oil</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>1 alloro leaf</li>

    </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>

    <strong><ol>
      <li>To make the risotto, start by preparing the meat stock.</li>
      <li>In the meantime, peel the leeks and remove the stalks: now chop the vegetables into a very fine mixture.</li>
      <li>Melt 30 g of butter with the oil in a non-stick pan, over a very low heat. When the butter is completely melted, brown the spring onion while stirring continuously to cook it evenly: it will take about 6 minutes because the spring onion should be almost completely "melted".</li>
      <li>Then toast the rice for about 3-4 minutes, stirring continuously. Pour in the Barolo and, when it has partially evaporated, add the stock: keep stirring to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Add a washed and dried bay leaf and season the risotto with fragrance.</li>
      <li>Allow the stock to be absorbed and, each time the previous ladle of liquid has been absorbed, add another ladle until the rice is cooked to perfection. This will take about 15-20 minutes. Add salt to adjust the flavour of the risotto.</li>
      <li>Finally, turn off the heat and remove the alloro leaf using kitchen tongs.</li>
      <li>Add a glass of this elegant wine on the side and.. Buona degustazione!</li>
